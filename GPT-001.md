## \[2023.02.02 - Exp. GPT-001\] 


In the following Experiment, we will apply ChatGPT LLM capabilities to filter out news headlines.  
```
"Why?"  
```   
Just trust a totally not random andy, results will speak for themselves \[*cit. H. Niemann*\]

#### Methodology:
We'll feed headlines from the news aggregator [Brutalist Report](https://brutalist.report/topic/news?) to ChatGPT.  
And then we'll ask GPT to filter out unwanted news and see what happens.

#### Hypothesis:
- LLM are very good with words;
- Headlines are words;
- LLM should be perfectly able to filter out the rabble and surface the shiny pearls.   

The following prompt will be used:  

```
From the following headlines list, filter out any line that implies the article is about:
- crime
- celebrities
- politics
- economics and finance
- sports
```

#### Results:
GPT struggles hopelessy. The list GPT outputs will always include, for example, headlines about Tom Brady.  
```
 "GPT uh, what is happening? Tom Brady should be filtered out triggering both the celebrity and sports filter."  
```

The reply of GPT is always a quantum superposition of:
1. Yes you are right Tom Brady is both a celebrity and a sportsman but at the same time he is a sportsman and a celebrity and so it's correct to not filter out the Tom Brady headlines \[**DementedGPT**\]
2. Correct, apologies for the confusion, here is the updated filtered list, *manually removes the two Tom Brady articles, leaves in all the many other titles that shouldn't pass the filter for similar reasons* \[**Compliant-Communist-State GPT**\]
3. I'm sorry but I'm just a small cute uwu LLM, I cannot think, please stop hitting me with facts and logic \[**TraumaGPT**\]  


#### Strategic reassessing:
How is that even possible? A LLM should be a master at this kind of parlor trick: parsing a token, reading the sentiment, generating an output. What am I missing?   
I'll omit all the failed attempts but let me tell you that GPT is very accurate at classifying news into buckets like: \[*crime, religion, equal rights, sex, politics, economics, tech, science, sports, lifestyle, celebrities, other*\]. Something suspiciously wrong happens when GPT is asked to filter out news based on the buckets, or maybe my prompt skills are lacking, I dunno - but luckily I stumbled into something better.   
Folksies I present you the Prompty Grail:  
 
```
From the following list of headlines,  
select the headlines that suggest the writer has conducted extensive historical research or deep comparative analysis on the topic 
```


#### Results - day 2023-02-02:

(*Please note that I didn't bother screenshotting the outputs, I assure you these are legit results. Why would a not random andy from the internet ever lie? It should be easy enough for anyone to replicate the average quality of the results*)

#### Comment and further research:
GPT output is, - imo - pretty good, both in terms of quantity chopping and in terms of subjective better quality of the headlines.   
Two more days of testing are in order. See ya!
